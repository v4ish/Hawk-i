## FAQ

#### "I got VAC banned using Hawk-i !"

- The risk of getting VAC Ban using Hawk-i is very low, however not zero.
- VAC marked you for ban when you were NOT using Hawk-i, but the actual ban was delayed. VAC often delays bans by as much as 2 weeks.
- You were not VAC banned, but rather banned by overwatch or untrusted.

#### How not to get VAC BAN

- Use a VAC Bypasser
- Use a MD5 Hash changer
- Download the latest version of Hawk-i
- Don't play using Hawk-i after a CSGO update (wait for the new release or create a issue)
